Our Family has been growing and preserving for over 5 Generations.  Originating from the north Georgia mountains, our family lived on a 200 acre homestead farm.  Our parents and their parent and so on, lived off the land passing down traditions techniques through the years.  These traditions we still use to this day.  With more and more people these days buying food in stores with no other options as they have forgotten how to sustain themselves.  We have a passion for sharing our knowledge and our experience with as many people as we can.  With GMO foods being spread throughout our nation and chemical pesticides and fertilizers being used even for "Organic" labeled food.  How can you know if your vegetables are good for you and not harmful.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fc92a786-7518-4690-a210-6acf48f0b77d.jpg)
